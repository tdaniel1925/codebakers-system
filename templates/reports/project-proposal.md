## Understanding

[Restate the client's problem or goal in their own language. This demonstrates that we listened and understood. No technical jargon — this section should feel like the client wrote it themselves.]

**Desired Outcome:**
- [What success looks like from the client's perspective]
- [Key goals the project must achieve]
- [How the client will measure success]

## Team

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| Project Lead | Overall delivery, client communication, architecture decisions |
| AI Development Team | Feature development, testing, deployment via CodeBakers agent system |
| QA & Review | Quality assurance, security review, performance testing |

---

## Assumptions & Dependencies

### Assumptions
1. [Client provides all necessary content, copy, and assets by agreed dates]
2. [Client designates a single point of contact for feedback and approvals]
3. [Feedback turnaround is within 48 hours to maintain the timeline]
4. [Third-party accounts and API keys are set up before development begins (e.g., Stripe, Resend)]
5. [Designs follow our standard design system unless custom design is scoped separately]

### Dependencies
1. [Any external system or team that must deliver before we can proceed]
2. [Third-party service availability or approval]
3. [Client decisions that must be made before specific phases can begin]

---

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| [Requirements change mid-project] | Medium | High | Phased delivery with scope review at each milestone |
| [Third-party API limitations discovered] | Low | Medium | Proof-of-concept integration in Phase 1, week 1 |
| [Client feedback delays] | Medium | Medium | Async feedback process, placeholder content strategy |
| [Unexpected technical complexity] | Low | High | 20% buffer included in estimates, scope negotiation if exceeded |

---

## How We Work

**Communication:**
- [Weekly status updates via email / Slack / preferred channel]
- [Milestone demos at end of each phase]
- [Dedicated Slack channel / communication channel for quick questions]

**Transparency:**
- Access to project repository for full visibility into progress
- Status reports include health scores and metrics
- No surprises — risks communicated as soon as identified

**Quality:**
- Every feature built with automated testing
- Code reviewed against professional standards
- Performance and security checked before every deploy
- Production monitoring active from day one

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this proposal** — Let us know if any scope adjustments are needed
2. **Approve and sign** — We'll send a formal agreement based on this proposal
3. **Kick off** — [X days] from approval, we begin Phase 1
4. **First milestone delivery** — [X weeks] from kick off
